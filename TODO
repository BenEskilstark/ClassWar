  - Each time a policy is minimized/maximized the values are re-computed
  - upkeepCosts just erase money --> who are they paying?
  - policies
    - policy which detects running out of food
    - when a faction can't afford to pay for what it needs, make favorable policies more likely
    - policy to print money (but increase prices/rents)
  - corporations can hit 0 favorability with plenty of money and keep wanting the massive
    bailout.
    - need a separate bailout like strike breaking, or that doesn't raise prices
  - with farms added:
    - farmer wages are too high (no rent tho?)
    - policy to switch workers to farmers and back
    - say how short of food they are when don't have enough
  - farmers end up with foodInventory: NaN when they shouldn't have that property at all


- - - - - - POSSIBLE CHANGE - - - - - -
  - what if middle class work for the other classes
    - upkeep for intelligentsia, marketing for corps,
  - with policy popping in your face every tick hard to focus on what's changing
    - show way less information (to fit on mobile?)
  - could make it play in real time while you deliberate on policies with more
    forgiving monies/favorabilities


- - - - - BALANCE - - - - - -
  - strategy problems?
    - can keep favorability artificially high just by rejecting policies they oppose
    - awkward when one policy is clearly necessary to survive but won't get recommended
    - what's stopping strategy of just always choosing policy to help poorest faction?
      - policies need more/nuanced changes?
    - initial conditions -> which factions are net positive, inventory, food,
      - easy/medium/hard/random with number of deltas?
  - policies should be more likely based on wealth/wealthDelta of factions
    - policies that reduce benefits should be inverse weighted
  - just can't raise prices without raising wages for working class
  - too many policies that punish working/middle when corps are doing poorly don't
    actually help the corporations
  - worker's wage must be more than (price * demand + rent)
    - how else can corporations make money to afford this pay?
  - skill of middle class (universities!) just doesn't seem to matter


- - - - - - BUGS - - - - - -
  - auto-playing ticks still hides indicators when policy pops up


- - - - - - UI - - - - - -
  - have description as first line of hovercards?
  - also hovercard description of each faction on their name
  - rename Factions to Class?
  - View Policy button should hide it when clicked again
  - add government type to main info based on favorability
    (and wealth? or history of favorable policies)
  - get up and down arrows to look the same
  - better printing of faction props
  - better lay out of the policy UI and percents/dollars and buttons


- - - - - SIMULATION - - - - - -
  - history
    - total favorability across all turns
    - times sided with vs sided against
    - weighted by number of policies in config that they support?
  - favorability changes
    - consequences of unfavorability per faction
      - middle/working class -> strikes
      - corps -> raising prices
      - landowners -> raising rents
      - military ->
      - intelligentsia -> leave (reducing bonuses?)
    - bonuses for high favorability ?
      - poor -> ?
      - middle class -> greater skill
      - corps -> greater production


- - - - - - POLICIES - - - - - -
  - policy system
    - allow some policies to be picked multiple times and others to only be picked once
    - maybe have a hard-coded smaller set of policies to choose from at first
    - procedurally generate policies?


- - - - - POLISH/FLAVOR - - - - -
  - have factions at/near 0% favorability blink or something
  - need dicts for money/percents
    - in policy_change, in policy display, in game ui
    - specifically favorability
  - print out a few messages at the start with instructions
    - welcome dear leader ... hopefully you can last longer than the last one
    - but try to incorporate name of the game in there (Command Economy 2?)
  - ticker
    - months in power should be years + months (weeks?)
